I deduced that from https://zerotobyte.com/complete-guide-to-django-foreignkey/. And indeed in views.py we must refer to this field as "user_id", not "user", otherwise we get the ValueError '"Abv.user" must be a "User" instance.' 'Setting db_column = "user"' here (and changing views.py to "intermediary_form.user = request.user.id" rather than "intermediary_form.user_id = request.user.id") results in the same ValueError. I don't understand.
